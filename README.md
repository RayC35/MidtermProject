# MidtermProject

## Description
National ParkCore is a web application designed to help users explore and share their experiences at national parks of the United States. Users can create, view, and update park and amenity information, as well as leave detailed reviews and ratings. The app is intended to help users make informed decisions about their visits to parks and amenities, offering insight from other visitors.

This program includes features for creating and managing national parks and amenities, along with functionality for users to log their visits and provide ratings. Users can also track and review the amenities theyâ€™ve visited, helping the app grow as a valuable resource for national park enthusiasts. Admins have the ability to manage content, including editing and enabling/disabling parks, amenities and users.

Looking Ahead: In the future, we hope to add more features to this application. Features such as:  the ability for users to reply to comments and reviews of other users, the capacity for users to have followers, and allowing users to craft a list of favorite parks/amenities.

## Difficulties and Lessons Learned
While this project was a demanding task for our team, it also proved to be a valuable learning experience. Our initial challenge was reaching a consensus on the application's functionality and subject matter. Following that, deciding on the overall structure and wireframing the site proved more complex than anticipated -- highlighting the importance of thorough planning. 

In the beginning we also struggled with managing our workflow effectively; instead of focusing on one user story at a time, we often found ourselves juggling multiple tasks, which led to confusion and slower progress.

Another significant challenge was maintaining consistency in file naming conventions. Miscommunication regarding file names caused difficulty in tracking and resolving errors, especially when file names were similar or unclear. This taught us the critical value of clear communication and standardized practices within a team. 

Despite these hurdles, completing a viable project within a tight timeframe helped us develop better project management skills and emphasized the importance of collaboration and communication in a development environment. We've all come away with a greater confidence in our own abilities, a greater respect for the work that goes into such a project, and of course, we are all proud of the web application we have created.
